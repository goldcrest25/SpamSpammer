# SpamSpammer

A Python project for spamming an API endpoint relentlessly with bogus data, e.g. one of those stupid Facebook scams that makes the rounds.

_Oh, you want_ credentials _do you? Oh, I'll give you some damn credentials!_ ðŸ˜ˆ

## Inputifier

Has methods to take a random line from the input file (currently "nasty-things-to-say") and output as an email address or passwword.

## SpamModule

Sends email/password via HTTP POST to the configured API endpoint.

**NOTE** â€“ please don't look at "nasty-things-to-say.txt" if you're easily offended!
